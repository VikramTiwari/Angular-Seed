# Angular Seed

A seed for creating Angular based web apps.

How to run
==========

I like to use Python for running a static file server. Use the following command to start off.

'''
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

'''

This will start serving the app on http://localhost:8000

PS: Make sure you have python 2.7 installed and in the $PATH
